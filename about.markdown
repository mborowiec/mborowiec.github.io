##### Location: San Diego, CA

I am developer with **over 12 years of native mobile iOS development** with focus on UI and Data layer. Passionate about building pixel-perfect mobile (native iOS) apps with focus on **scalability and testability** of the project.
I love working on challenging tasks and codebases that require refactor (either due to lack of testability, lack of modularity that enables co-located teams to work on the same codebase, and many other various reasons).

My experience includes working on low level **Core Graphics, Core Animation** (Analytics app with charts), **UIKit, data layer** (sometimes in C++ if necessary...).

At work I love **collaboration**. I would not be where I am, if not constant and great feedback I had received either through PRs or simply, pair programming and architectural discussions.
Now I am learning SwiftUI by writing my latest side app using mainly that framework (to learn more, look at my blog!).

Professionally I am taking break from mobile development to focus on backend skills, so I just joined team that works on data streaming using Kafka.

But I am not abandoning mobile development. As I mentioned before, I am still working on side project which is native app, with backend that I wrote in Node.js.
